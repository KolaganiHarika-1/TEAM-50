Smart Market Assistant is a web-based application designed to help small businesses and local shops manage products, assist customers with smart browsing, and simplify the ordering process.

The system enables users to view products category-wise, search items, add them to a cart, save delivery details, and place orders, all through a simple and lightweight interface.

This project demonstrates how digital tools can empower small retailers and help them compete in a rapidly growing digital market

**Project Idea – Smart Market Assistant**

Small businesses and local shops often face challenges such as:

Difficulty competing with large e-commerce platforms

Lack of affordable technical solutions

At the same time, many existing digital market solutions are:

Expensive

Complex to use

Dependent on backend infrastructure and constant internet connectivity
